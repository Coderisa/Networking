1)REPEATER
A Repeater regenerates signals. A repeater is a device that amplifies or adds to incoming electrical signals and retransmits them, in order to compensate for transmission losses.
Since it amplifies the signal, it requires a source of electric power.
Acress communication across greater distances.
